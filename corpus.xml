          This corpus is developed from HISe's scholarly edition of the Henrik
          Ibsen's Writings, which comprises all of Ibsen's published (and many
          unpublished) works. The project was started in 1999 and completed in
          2010. It is maintained by the Centre for Ibsen Studies at the
          University of Oslo.

        <p>
          The works included in this DraCor corpus are all of Ibsen's published
          dramas, as well as his unpublished drama manuscripts. Also included
          are various versions of a selection of plays. The reason for this
          inclusion is that the versions often carry significant differences.
          Some may have been updated with a modernised language, and others in
          other formats. However, the versions typically carry with them
          semantic differences, which may be of interest for some areas of
          research.
